## Portfolio
This is my portfolio website which includes an about me section, links to my github, email, linkedin, and resume, a contact section and a section that displays various projects. 

## Description
This website will introduce me as a new developer. It provides a way for employers to get to know more about me, look at some of the works i have developed, and links for easy access to different social accounts and contact. 

# Materials Used 

React and JSX were the main coding programs. CSS and HTML were also utilized. Other web API's like bootstrap react, font awesome, and google fonts were utilized. 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
