                Over the years I have learned I feel most accomplished when I create something. Through my years of experience being a dance instructor to now engaging in software developement, creation is my muse. I love being able to see the process and the product of work. It may not be assumed, but code and dance share similarities. I have found beauty in both of these fields and hope to continue to help create beautiful things for many.
